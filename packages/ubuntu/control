Description: pdfpres is a presentation program for PDF files. 
             It uses a "dual head"-layout: One window shows the 
             previous, current and next slides while another 
             window only shows the current slide. That additional 
             window can be moved to an external screen (such as a 
             beamer). Thus, you can present your slides on a 
             beamer while keeping an eye on what's coming up next.
