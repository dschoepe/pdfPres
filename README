README for pdfPres
==================

pdfPres is (going to be) a presentation program for PDF files. It uses a
"dual head"-layout: One window shows the previous, current and next
slide while another window only shows the current slide. That additional
window can be moved to an external screen (such as a beamer) -- use your
window manager to set this window to fullscreen. Thus, you can present
your slides on a beamer while keeping overview of what's coming next.

pdfPres uses GTK+ 2.0 and poppler-glib to render the PDF file.
