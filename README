README for pdfPres
==================

pdfPres is a presentation program for PDF files. It uses a "dual head"-layout:
One window shows the previous, current and next slides while another window
only shows the current slide. That additional window can be moved to an
external screen (such as a beamer) -- use your window manager to set this
window to fullscreen. Thus, you can present your slides on a beamer while
keeping an eye on what's coming up next.

pdfPres uses GTK+ v2 and poppler-glib to render the PDF file.


KEYS:
- Use the cursor keys to navigate ([Space], [Return] also go the next slide).
- [p] switches to "fit page", this is the default.
- [w] switches to "fit to width" mode, [h] switches to "fit to height" mode.
- [F5] does a dumb refresh.
- [Escape], [q] quit the program.


TODO:
- Automatic conversion from regular pathes to URI's. For now, you'll have to
  launch the program like this:

    $ ./pdfPres -f file:///home/whoever/work/slides.pdf [-s <slides>]

  The optional parameter "-s" allows you to specify how many slides
  before/after the current slide you wish to see, i.e. "3" means "preview the
  next 3 slides while still showing the previous 3 slides". The default is "2".

- ... some cosmetic stuff ...


Build instructions
==================

To build the binary you need SConstruct <http://www.scons.org/> which should be
included in most linux distributions. Once that's installed, just grab the
source and type:

    $ cd /path/to/sources
    $ scons

That's it. Furthermore, the following external libraries are required:

- gtk2 >= 2.16.1            <http://www.gtk.org>
- poppler-glib >= 0.10.6    <http://poppler.freedesktop.org>
